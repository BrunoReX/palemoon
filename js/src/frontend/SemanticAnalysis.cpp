/*
 * Walk the function box list at |*funboxHead|, removing boxes for deleted
 * functions and cleaning up method lists. We do this once, before
 * performing function analysis, to avoid traversing possibly long function
 * lists repeatedly when recycling nodes.
 *
 * There are actually three possible states for function boxes and their
 * nodes:
 *
 * - Live: funbox->node points to the node, and funbox->node->pn_funbox
 *   points back to the funbox.
 *
 * - Recycled: funbox->node points to the node, but funbox->node->pn_funbox
 *   is NULL. When a function node is part of a tree that gets recycled, we
 *   must avoid corrupting any method list the node is on, so we leave the
 *   function node unrecycled until we call CleanFunctionList. At recycle
 *   time, we clear such nodes' pn_funbox pointers to indicate that they
 *   are deleted and should be recycled once we get here.
 *
 * - Mutated: funbox->node is NULL; the contents of the node itself could
 *   be anything. When we mutate a function node into some other kind of
 *   node, we lose all indication that the node was ever part of the
 *   function box tree; it could later be recycled, reallocated, and turned
 *   into anything at all. (Fortunately, method list members never get
 *   mutated, so we don't have to worry about that case.)
 *   ParseNodeAllocator::prepareNodeForMutation clears the node's function
 *   box's node pointer, disconnecting it entirely from the function box tree,
 *   and marking the function box to be trimmed out.

 * f's parameter p, so if o_m escapes f's activation scope, g does too and
 * cannot assume that p's stack slot is still alive. In contast function h
 * neither escapes nor uses an upvar "above" o_m's level.
 *
 * If function g itself contained lambdas that contained non-lambdas that reach
 * up above its level, then those non-lambdas would have to be marked too. This
 * process is potentially exponential in the number of functions, but generally
 * not so complex. But it can't be done during a single recursive traversal of
 * the funbox tree, so we must use a work queue.
 *
 * Return the minimal "skipmin" for funbox and its siblings. This is the delta
