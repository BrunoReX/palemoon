/*
 * Note to themers:
 *
 * This CSS (and associated XBL/XUL) was added/changed for the landing of
 * the new UI for crashed plugins in Gecko 1.9.2.3 (aka Firefox 3.6.3). To
 * avoid the new UI from breaking when using existing themes, we've shipped
 * the new CSS and images in /content instead of /skin.
 *
 * If you wish to theme this UI, you should add your CSS to this file and
 * override the rules set by the /content CSS:
 *   chrome://mozapps/content/plugins/pluginProblemLorentz.css.
 *
 * The next major release (Gecko 1.9.3.x) will not have the /content
 * pluginProblemLorentz.css; it's contents will be in this file, in /skin
 * along with the images it references.
