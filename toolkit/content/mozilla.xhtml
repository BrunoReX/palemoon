  <h1>Mozilla: In Memoriam</h1>
  <br/>
  Dedicated to the tireless developers who have come and gone.<br/>
  To those who have put their heart and soul into Mozilla products.<br/>
  To those who have seen their good intentions and hard work squandered.<br/>
  To those who really cared about the user, and cared about usability.<br/>
  To those who truly understood us and desired freedom, but were unheard.<br/>
  To those who knew that change is inevitable, but loss of vision is not.<br/>
  To those who were forced to give up the good fight.<br/>
  <br/>
  <em>Thank you.</em> Pale Moon would not have been possible without you.<br/>
