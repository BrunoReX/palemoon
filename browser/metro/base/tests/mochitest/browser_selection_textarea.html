Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it
had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice
`without pictures or conversation?'

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried
to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards
and book-shelves;(end)</textarea>
