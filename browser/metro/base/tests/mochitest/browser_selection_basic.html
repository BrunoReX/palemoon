There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of
the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she
thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.
<br>
<br>
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she
was to get out again.
<br>
<br>
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she
found herself falling down a very deep well.
