 * This is a cairo/Thebes surface, but with a literal twist. Scrolling
 * causes the layer's visible region to move. We want to keep
 * reusing the same surface if the region size hasn't changed, but we don't
 * want to keep moving the contents of the surface around in memory. So
 * we use a trick.
 * Consider just the vertical case, and suppose the buffer is H pixels
 * high and we're scrolling down by N pixels. Instead of copying the
 * buffer contents up by N pixels, we leave the buffer contents in place,
 * and paint content rows H to H+N-1 into rows 0 to N-1 of the buffer.
 * Then we can refresh the screen by painting rows N to H-1 of the buffer
 * at row 0 on the screen, and then painting rows 0 to N-1 of the buffer
 * at row H-N on the screen.
 * mBufferRotation.y would be N in this example.
