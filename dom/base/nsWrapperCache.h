/**
 * Class to store the wrapper for an object. This can only be used with objects
 * that only have one non-security wrapper at a time (for an XPCWrappedNative
 * this is usually ensured by setting an explicit parent in the PreCreate hook
 * for the class).
 *
 * An instance of nsWrapperCache can be gotten from an object that implements
 * a wrapper cache by calling QueryInterface on it. Note that this breaks XPCOM
 * rules a bit (this object doesn't derive from nsISupports).
 *
 * The cache can store objects other than wrappers. We allow wrappers to use a
 * separate JSObject to store their state (mostly expandos). If the wrapper is
 * collected and we want to preserve this state we actually store the state
 * object in the cache.
 *
 * The cache can store 3 types of objects:
 *
 *  If WRAPPER_IS_PROXY is not set (IsProxy() returns false):
 *    - a slim wrapper or the JSObject of an XPCWrappedNative wrapper
 *
 *  If WRAPPER_IS_PROXY is set (IsProxy() returns true):
 *    - a proxy wrapper
 *    - an expando object
 *
 * If a proxy wrapper is GCed and it has an expando object we'll store the
 * expando object in the cache. If we create a new proxy wrapper and the cache
 * contains an expando object we'll store the expando object in the new wrapper
 * and store the new wrapper in the cache. Unlinking from the cycle collector
 * clears anything stored in the cache.
 *
 * A number of the methods are implemented in nsWrapperCacheInlines.h because we
 * have to include some JS headers that don't play nicely with the rest of the
 * codebase. Include nsWrapperCacheInlines.h if you need to call those methods.
