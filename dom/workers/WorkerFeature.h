  // close handler with no expiration time.
  Terminating,

  // Either the user navigated away from the owning page or the owning page fell
  // out of bfcache. Setting this status causes the worker to abort immediately
  // and schedules the close handler with a short expiration time. Since the
  // page has gone away the worker may not post any messages.
  Canceling,

  // The application is shutting down. Setting this status causes the worker to
  // abort immediately and the close handler is never scheduled.
  Killing,

  // The close handler has run and the worker is effectively dead.
