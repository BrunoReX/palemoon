The source from this directory was copied from the libfishsound git
distribution using the update.sh script. The only changes made
were those applied by update.sh and the addition/upate of Makefile.in
files for the Mozilla build system.

Some files are renamed during the copy to prevent clashes with object
file names with other Mozilla libraries.
