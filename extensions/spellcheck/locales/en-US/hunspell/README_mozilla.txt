Mozilla has added some words to its English dictionary via mozilla_words.diff.
Some of these words are regular words that are missing from the Hunspell
dictionary, and some are brand names such as "SeaMonkey" that are valuable to
Mozilla's users. The patch for these words is checked in alongside the
dictionary. This patch should be re-applied if the dictionary is updated.
