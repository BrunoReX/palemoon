/**
 * Class DOMSVGStringList
 *
 * This class is used to create the DOM tearoff objects that wrap internal
 * SVGPathData objects.
 *
 * See the architecture comment in DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList.h first (that's
 * LENGTH list), then continue reading the remainder of this comment.
 *
 * The architecture of this class is similar to that of DOMSVGLengthList
 * except for two important aspects:
 *
 * First, since there is no nsIDOMSVGAnimatedStringList interface in SVG, we
 * have no parent DOMSVGAnimatedStringList (unlike DOMSVGLengthList which has
 * a parent DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList class). As a consequence, much of the
 * logic that would otherwise be in DOMSVGAnimatedStringList (and is in
 * DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList) is contained in this class.
 *
 * Second, since there is no nsIDOMSVGString interface in SVG, we have no
 * DOMSVGString items to maintain. As far as script is concerned, objects
 * of this class contain a list of strings, not a list of mutable objects
 * like the other SVG list types. As a result, unlike the other SVG list
 * types, this class does not create its items lazily on demand and store
 * them so it can return the same objects each time. It simply returns a new
 * string each time any given item is requested.

   * The cached object is only removed from the cache when it is destroyed due
   * to there being no more references to it. If that happens, any subsequent
   * call requesting the DOM wrapper for the SVGStringList will naturally
   * result in a new DOMSVGStringList being returned.
