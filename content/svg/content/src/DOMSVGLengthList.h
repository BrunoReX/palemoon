 * Class DOMSVGLengthList

 * SVGLengthList objects.
 *
 * See the architecture comment in DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList.h.
 *
 * This class is strongly intertwined with DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList and
 * DOMSVGLength. We are a friend of DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList, and are
 * responsible for nulling out our DOMSVGAnimatedLengthList's pointer to us
 * when we die, essentially making its pointer to us a weak pointer. Similarly,
 * our DOMSVGLength items are friends of us and responsible for nulling out our
 * pointers to them.
 *
 * Our DOM items are created lazily on demand as and when script requests them.
