The canonical location for this testsuite is:

All files and directories in this directory, with the exceptions listed below, come from
upstream and should not be modified without corresponding upstream fixes and/or a
patch file in this directory. The exceptions (the Mozilla-specific files) are:
 * the crossorigin directory is not from upstream (not easy to share, as it relies on special features of the HTTP server used for our test framework)
 * README.mozilla (this file)
 * failing_tests_*.txt
 * Makefile.in
 * *.patch files, if any
