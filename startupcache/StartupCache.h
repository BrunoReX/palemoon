/**
 * The StartupCache is a persistent cache of simple key-value pairs,
 * where the keys are null-terminated c-strings and the values are 
 * arbitrary data, passed as a (char*, size) tuple. 
 *
 * Clients should use the GetSingleton() static method to access the cache. It 
 * will be available from the end of XPCOM init (NS_InitXPCOM3 in nsXPComInit.cpp), 
 * until XPCOM shutdown begins. The GetSingleton() method will return null if the cache
 * is unavailable. The cache is only provided for libxul builds --
 * it will fail to link in non-libxul builds. The XPCOM interface is provided
 * only to allow compiled-code tests; clients should avoid using it.
 *
 * The API provided is very simple: GetBuffer() returns a buffer that was previously
 * stored in the cache (if any), and PutBuffer() inserts a buffer into the cache.
 * GetBuffer returns a new buffer, and the caller must take ownership of it.
 * PutBuffer will assert if the client attempts to insert a buffer with the same name as
 * an existing entry. The cache makes a copy of the passed-in buffer, so client
 * retains ownership.
 *
 * InvalidateCache() may be called if a client suspects data corruption 
 * or wishes to invalidate for any other reason. This will remove all existing cache data.
 * Finally, getDebugObjectOutputStream() allows debug code to wrap an objectstream
 * with a debug objectstream, to check for multiply-referenced objects. These will
 * generally fail to deserialize correctly, unless they are stateless singletons or the 
 * client maintains their own object data map for deserialization.
 *
 * Writes before the final-ui-startup notification are placed in an intermediate
 * cache in memory, then written out to disk at a later time, to get writes off the
 * startup path. In any case, clients should not rely on being able to GetBuffer()
 * data that is written to the cache, since it may not have been written to disk or
 * another client may have invalidated the cache. In other words, it should be used as
 * a cache only, and not a reliable persistent store.
 *
 * Some utility functions are provided in StartupCacheUtils. These functions wrap the
 * buffers into object streams, which may be useful for serializing objects. Note
 * the above caution about multiply-referenced objects, though -- the streams are just
 * as 'dumb' as the underlying buffers about multiply-referenced objects. They just
 * provide some convenience in writing out data.
