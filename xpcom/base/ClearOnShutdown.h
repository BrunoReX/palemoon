/*
 * This header exports one public method in the mozilla namespace:
 *
 *   template<class SmartPtr>
 *   void ClearOnShutdown(SmartPtr *aPtr)
 *
 * This function takes a pointer to a smart pointer (i.e., nsCOMPtr<T>*,
 * nsRefPtr<T>*, or nsAutoPtr<T>*) and nulls the smart pointer on shutdown.
 *
 * This is useful if you have a global smart pointer object which you don't
 * want to "leak" on shutdown.
 *
 * There is no way to undo a call to ClearOnShutdown, so you can call it only
 * on smart pointers which you know will live until the program shuts down.
