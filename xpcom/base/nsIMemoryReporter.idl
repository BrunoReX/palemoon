   * The path that this memory usage should be reported under.  Paths are

   *   been explicitly allocated with an OS-level allocation (eg.
   *   mmap/VirtualAlloc/vm_allocate) or a heap-level allocation (eg.
   *   malloc/calloc/operator new).
   *
   *   Each reporter can be viewed as representing a node in a tree rooted at
   *   "explicit".  Not all nodes of the tree need have an associated reporter.
   *   So, for example, the reporters "explicit/a/b", "explicit/a/c",
   *   "explicit/d", "explicit/d/e", and "explicit/d/f" define this tree:
   *
   *     explicit

   *     |  \--c [*]
   *     \--d [*]
   *        |--e [*]
   *        \--f [*]
   *
   *   Nodes marked with a [*] have a reporter.  Notice that "explicit/a" is
   *   implicitly defined.
   *
   *   A node's children divide their parent's memory into disjoint pieces.
   *   So in the example above, |a| may not count any allocations counted by
   *   |d|, and vice versa.
   *
   * - All other paths represent cross-cutting values and may overlap with any
